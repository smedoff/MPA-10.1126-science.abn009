  \caption{Cap MonthYr (100NM): Each successive column displays results for the 4 species groups Bigeye, Yellowfin, All, and Other, using a difference-in-difference regression. DID coefficients measure the effect of fishing close to PMNM after PMNM was expanded in the 2016. The sample runs from January 6, 2010 to January 11, 2020. $^{*}$p$<$0.1; $^{**}$p$<$0.05; $^{***}$p$<$0.01 Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors presented in parentheses.}
