Abstract 

   *Previous research has cast doubt on the potential for marine protected areas (MPAs) to provide refuge and fishery spillover benefits for migratory species as most MPAs are small relative to the geographic range of these species. We test for evidence of spillover benefits accruing from the world’s largest fully protected MPA, Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. Using species-specific data collected by independent fishery observers, we examine changes in catch rates for individual vessels near to and far from the MPA before and after its expansion in 2016. We find evidence of spillover benefits for yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus).*
   
About 
  
  The purpose of this study is to estimate the potential spillover benefits quantified as increased catch per unit effort, or CPUE, caused by the expansion of the world's largest no-take marine reserve. This project leverages two confidential data sets administered by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The first is the observer data which is reported by 3rd party observers onboard commercial longline vessels. The second is the logbook data which is self-reported by fishing captains. Due to the confidentiality agreement, neither data set is made publically available. However, summary data aggregated by a 1x1 and 5x5 degree grid can be found https://www.wcpfc.int/wcpfc-public-domain-aggregated-catcheffort-data-download-page 
This repo is organized as an R program. Each script will execute one task needed for the final publication. Each script is created with the flexibility to input either the observer data or the logbook data so execute each task.
